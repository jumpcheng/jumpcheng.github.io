      Learning Competencies:
        <ul>
          <li>Research time management and productivity</li>
            <dl>
              <dt><strong><dfn>Time management</dfn></strong></dt>

            </dl>
          
          Benefits of managing your time well can result to:
          <ul>      
            <li>Greater productivity and efficiency</li>
            <li>A better professional reputation.</li>
            <li>Less Stress</li>
            <li>Increased opportunities for advancement</li>
            <li>Greater opportunities to achieve important life and career goals.</li>
          </ul>          
          Failing to manage your time can lead you to:
          <ul> 
            <li>Missed deadlines</li>
            <li>Inefficient workflow</li>
            <li>Poor work quality</li>
            <li>A poor professional repuration and a stalled career</li>
            <li>Higher stress levels</li>
          </ul>    
              
              <br />
          <dl>
          <dt><strong><dfn>Productivity</dfn></strong></dt>
            <dd>A measure of the efficiency of a person in converting inputs into outputs.</dd> 
          </dl>
            <em>Time management</em> and <em>productivity</em> go hand in hand since the dedicated time you have managed for a certain task requires for you to be productive in doing the task in order to make the most out of the time set aside for the specific task.
              
              <br />
              <br />

          <li>Explain "Time Boxing" and explain how to use it</li>
            <br />
              <dt><strong><dfn>Time Box</dfn></strong></dt>
                <dd>A previously agreed period of time during which a person or a team works steadily towards completion of some goal. Rather than to continuously work until the goal is reached and evaluating the time taken, the timebox approach consists of stopping work when the time limit is reached and evaluating what was accomplished.</dd>
                  <br />
                Time boxing depends on varying the time scales. A common technique that is used is the "pomdoro technique". This technique organizes personal work around 25-minute timeboxes with a 5 minute work break.
                <br />
                <br />

              <em>Always stop work at the end of the time box and review your progress. Determine whether your goal has been met, or partially met if it included multiple tasks.</em>
        </ul>
