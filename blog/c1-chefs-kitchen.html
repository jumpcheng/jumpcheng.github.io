  <h1>Cultural Blog: My Take on Dev Bootcamp</h1>
  <h2>Phase 0: Week 1</h2>
  <h4>May 7<sup>th</sup> 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      This will be my first blog post concerning my expectation's of Dev Bootcamp, I wonder how accurate the perception I have on DBC is and how different it will be from the reality that I will be diving into within the next couple weeks. Well this blog is concerning a video that we were told to watch. I've watched and read a few other videos and a couple blog posts bout Dev Bootcamp prior to this fireside chat. So my idea of DBC before having watched this video is that this will be a intense 18-week course where I will be exposed to a different take on education. I will be coding day and night and dream code, probably. After having watched the video, my take on the DBC experience has solidified and expanded. The impression I was given as a result of watching the video is that I will be exposed to a very open-minded and supportive environment. DBC does this through handpicking the student's after checking their characteristics and abilities with a guideline. Spending the 9-weeks remotely with my cohort and 9-weeks onsite with them, I will probably become very close with them. Having peered program for the first time was already very exciting to me, I am learning a lot by observing another person's take on the problem. I am able to receive and give feed back to one another after the sessions in order to help one another improve. Already, the challenges that I have been exposed to this week has been positive and I cannot wait to see what DBC has to offer throughout the next 17-weeks ahead of me. I believe that the educational system should encourage more of this environment, and considering this is my first time exposed to something like this, I can't help but to say that I am very excited to learn in this environment. I intend to retain as much knowledge as possible from my time here and hope that this will change my perception of education and I hope that the Engineering Empathy sessions which focus on Emotional Intelligence will allow me to change for the better working in groups. The environment that I will be exposed to makes me excited, but what makes me nervous is the fact that I will have to learn how to program at a surprising time span of 18-weeks. I am only hoping that I will manage to keep up with the upcoming weeks ahead of me and that I will be able to help my peers through this amazing experience.
