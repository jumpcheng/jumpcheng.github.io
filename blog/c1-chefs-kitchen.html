      I believe that the DBC experience will be an experience that I will not be able to replace. After watching multiple video's including Shereef's Fireside Chat has given me the impression that the institute will empower me by providing me all the tools necessary in a environment that will allow me to improve my skills learning how to learn as well as fundamental knowledge on Ruby. Having worked in the hospitality industry, this is a complete different culture than what I have experienced in the past. I believe it may take some time for me to get use to the change, but since I am able to adapt to different cultures well from being brought up in an international environment my whole life, I believe that this environment will be able one that I will adopt in my life. Shereef has mentioned in the "Fireside Chat" video that they provide a very supportive environment where they are aware of the student's progress. It gives me a feeling of relief that I will be able to succeed and it has taken the stress of getting asked to leave away.
