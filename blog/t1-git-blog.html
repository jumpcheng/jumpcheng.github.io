      What are the benefits of version control?

      Version control acts as a safety net for programmers when they are developing a software. Version control is a save point, or as known in computer games it is a check point for programmers. If a programmer makes a mistake, they can go back to where they last commit and they will be able to start their work from there. This creates a more effective work environment and makes it easier for programmers to code since they have a safety net that they can fall back to.

       How does Git help you keep track of changes?

       Git helps you keep track of changes by constantly allowing developers to update and comment on the changes they made and later on they can merge.

       Why use GitHub to store your code?

       GitHub is one of the biggest platforms for coders to use for developing programs. It allows for multiple developers to work on the same project without interfering with one another. Through the use of commit, it creates check points for programmers to fall back to. It is a useful tool that should be used and I cannot wait to learn how to use GitHub better.
